# diffsend - compare file to last time script was run and email diff report
#
# This script takes a filename, a regular expression, and an email address as
# arguments. If the file has never been checked before, the script makes a copy
# of it in /tmp and exits. On the next run, it checks to see if lines matching
# the regular expression have been added or removed from the file in the
# meantime, i.e. it checks for updates in regards to a particular matching
# string. If there is a difference, the diff report is emailed to the specified
# address. This is useful for monitoring log files.
